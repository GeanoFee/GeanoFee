# Hi there, I'm Geano 👋

I'm a Foundry VTT developer focused on **immersion** and **workflow automation**. My goal is to bridge the gap between technical complexity and a seamless cinematic tabletop experience.

## 🛠️ My Foundry VTT Modules

### 🗺️ Scene Management
* **[Geano's Scene Rotation](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-scene-rotation)**: The "missing feature" for Foundry. Rotate entire scenes (backgrounds, walls, lights, and tokens) with a single click.

### 🎬 Immersion & Visuals
* **Geanos CineBars**: Automatically adds cinematic letterbox bars when combat starts. Transform your encounters into movie-like experiences.
* **Geano's Notification Killer**: Keeps your players immersed by suppressing technical UI warnings and errors they can't fix anyway.

### ⚔️ System Integration
* **GDSA Polyglot Bridge**: A specialized bridge connecting **Goody's DSA4.1 Core** with the **Polyglot** module for automatic language detection.

## 🚀 What's next?
I am currently in the process of officially listing all my modules in the Foundry VTT package directory. 

* **Status:** `Geano's Scene Rotation` is currently under review for the official gallery.
* **Development:** Working on more Quality-of-Life tools for GMs.
