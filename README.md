# Hi there, I'm Geano 👋

I'm a **FoundryVTT Community Developer** dedicated to breaking the boundaries of virtual tabletop immersion. From high-performance engine optimizations to tiny immersion-treats, I build tools that transform how stories are told.

## 🏆 Featured Project: Geano's Phantom Performance
**Out-of-the-box Automation of Memory Management for FoundryVTT.**

* **The Problem:** Massive worlds with thousands of actors and complex scenes freeze browsers and bloat RAM usage.
* **The Solution:** GPP creates "Phantom" skeletons, offloading heavy JSON data to background storage while maintaining all world links and IDs.
* **Key Tech:** ES6 Proxy-Interception for Just-in-Time hydration, Atomic Write Safety for data integrity, and Predictive Pre-fetching.
* **Impact:** Up to **90% reduction** in initial world load times. -->

## 🏆 Featured Project: Geano's Jump'n'Run Editor
**Turning a VTT into a fully functional 2D Side-Scroller Physics Engine.**

* **The Innovation:** Breaks the top-down paradigm by introducing a custom real-time gravity and collision engine.
* **Level Design:** A full suite of tools to draw platforms, walls, hazards, and portals directly onto the canvas.
* **Multiplayer:** Fully networked physics — watch players jump, wall-slide, and fall in real-time.
* **Integration:** Deep bridge to *Monk's Active Tile Triggers* for retro-style heart systems and checkpoints.

## 🧪 Research & "Outside the Box" Development
I am currently investigating ways to challenge the inherent limitations of the FoundryVTT engine. My goal is to re-evaluate core engine constraints to enable experiences that were previously considered impossible in the FoundryVTT environment.

---

## 📈 Status & Roadmap
* **Official Status:** Core modules are fully approved and available in the FoundryVTT setup menu.
* **Current Focus:** Predictive "Just-in-Time" data hydration and deep integration with community standards like Monk's Active Tile Triggers.
