# Hi there, I'm Geano 👋

I'm a FoundryVTT developer dedicated to **cinematic immersion** and **deep workflow automation**. I build tools that handle the technical heavy lifting, so Game Masters and players can focus on the story.

## 🛠️ My FoundryVTT Modules

### 🎵 Immersive Audio
* **[Geano's SoundScape Realism](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-soundscape-realism)**: An overhaul of Foundry's audio engine. Features real-time acoustic occlusion (muffling) and procedural reverb zones calculated via multithreaded raycasting.
  
### 🏗️ Scene & Master Tools
* **[Geano's Scene Rotation](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-scene-rotation)**: Rotate entire scenes (walls, lights, and tokens) with a single click.
* **[Geano's Scene Optimizer](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-scene-optimizer)**: Optimize world performance by converting images to WebP and audio to OGG Opus using fast, browser-native WebCodecs.
* **[Geano's Notification Killer](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-notification-killer)**: Suppress technical UI warnings for players to maintain immersion.
* **[Geano's Carriage Shake](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-carriage-shake)**: Adds a synchronized screen-shake effect for bumpy rides and environmental hazards.

### 🎭 Cinematic & Visuals
* **[Geano's CineBars](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-cinebars)**: Automated cinematic letterbox bars for combat encounters.
* **[Geano's Token Grayscale](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-token-grayscale)**: Visual HP tracking by automatically tinting incapacitated tokens (DSA/gdsa).

### 💰 Economy & Automation
* **[Geano's DnD Coin Manager](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-coin-manager)**: Streamlined currency management and math inputs for dnd5e.
* **[Geano's GDSA Exchange Office](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-gdsa-exchange-office)**: Automated coin optimization and conversion for DSA 4.1.

### 🌍 System Bridges
* **[Geano's GDSA Polyglot Bridge](https://github.com/GeanoFee/geanos-gdsa-polyglot-bridge)**: Seamlessly connects Polyglot's language features with Goody's DSA4.1 Core.
